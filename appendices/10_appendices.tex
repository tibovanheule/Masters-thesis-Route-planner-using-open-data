\subsection*{SIRI}
SIRI provides an abstract model of common public transport concepts and data structures that enables the exchange of information on transport operations between different computer systems. SIRI was established as a European standard in October 2006. It is a CEN (European Committee for Standardisation) Technical Standard.

 Identification of Fixed Objects in Public Transport (incorporated into transmodel v6)
The project developed a logical data model for the fixed objects relevant for public transport, particularly for stops and points of interest. Transmodel v5.1 has been a fundamental input. IFOPT has been revised and incorporated into Transmodel v6 â€“ Part 2.
