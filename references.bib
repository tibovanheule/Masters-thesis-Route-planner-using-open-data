Therefore more and more researchers begin to realize that how important to have their domain ontology supporting for reason within the domain knowledge. In this paper, urban public transport ontology is proposed with the key concepts and relations in transportation system, and established by Protege and Jena software, to help solving some problems existing in transportation system, such as differentiating the same station names and querying with more semantic information. Also, we adopt an improved public transport transfer query algorithm which considers both road conditions and costumer's various needs, including transfer times, walking distance, and price etc. Finally, based on the proposed ontology and the improved query algorithm, we implement a public transport query system, and also do our preliminary experimental verification with six roads, 14 stations and 5 offices. And the experimental results show that our query system has good performance.},

	abstract = {City logistics is a discipline specialized to cope with the sustainability problems encountered in urban freight transport. A key characteristic of it is the heterogeneity of the stakeholders involved. Besides the traditional logistics actors such as shippers, carriers and receivers that share consistent interests (i.e. price and quality), city logistics highly respect the interests of public administrators and citizens that care more about the social welfare. To reach an optimal balance between private and public benefit, it is necessary to understand and in turn forecast the behavior pattern of different groups. In recent years, agent-based modeling has been practiced as an unconventional tool to fulfill this task for its strong capability on capturing the dynamic behavior of individual stakeholders and their interconnections. Referring to other domains (e.g. energy system) where the application of agent-based modeling is relatively mature, a following urgency is to achieve interoperability and in turn reusability between models via introducing formal ontology as a shared template with which developers can standardize their models. This paper introduces an initiative of developing an ontology that formalizes the domain knowledge of city logistics.},

Answering earliest-arrival queries in temporal graphs is one of the most fundamental studies with numerous applications, such as information diffusion and measuring temporal closeness centrality. As graph sizes are growing rapidly, speedup of query execution time becomes even more important.In this paper, we propose a novel edge-centric parallel algorithm for solving single-source earliest-arrival problem in temporal graphs based on a new data structure named Edge-Scan-Dependency Graph (ESD-Graph). We evaluate the proposed parallel algorithm by theoretical analysis as well as by empirical experiments on real-world temporal graphs and synthetic graphs. Empirical results show that the new parallel algorithm outperforms the existing serial algorithm by up to 8.2 and 9.5 times on multi-core processors for real-world data and synthetic data respectively.},

	abstract = {Given a temporal graph G, a source vertex s, and a departure time at source vertex ts, the earliest arrival time problem (EAT) is to start from s on or after ts and reach all the vertices in G as early as possible. Ni et al. have proposed a parallel algorithm for EAT and obtained a speedup up to 9.5× on real-world graphs with respect to the connection-scan serial algorithm by using multi-core processors. We propose a topology-driven parallel algorithm for EAT on public transport networks and implement using general-purpose programming on the graphics processing unit (GPU). A temporal connection in a temporal graph for a public transport network is associated with a departure time and a duration time, and many connections exist from u to v for an edge ( u, v). We propose two pruning techniques connection-type and clustering, and use arithmetic progression technique appropriately to process many connections of an edge, without scanning all of them. In the connection-type technique, the connections of an edge with the same duration are grouped together. In the clustering technique, we follow 24-hour format and the connections of an edge are partitioned into 24 clusters so that the departure time of connections in the ith cluster is at least i-hour and at most i+1-hour. The arithmetic progression technique helps to store a sequence of departure times of various connections in a compact way. We propose a hybrid approach to combine the three techniques (connection-type, clustering and arithmetic progression) in an efficient way. Our techniques achieve an average speedup up to 61× when compared to the existing connection-scan serial algorithm running on CPU. Also, the average speedup of our algorithm is 12.65× against the parallel edge-scan-dependency graph algorithm running on GPU.},

In the time-expanded approach, every event at a station, e.g., the departure of a train, is modeled as a node in the graph, while in the time-dependent approach the graph contains only one node per station. Both approaches have been recently considered for (a simplified version of) the earliest arrival problem, but little is known about their relative performance. Thus far, there are only theoretical arguments in favor of the time-dependent approach. In this paper, we provide the first extensive experimental comparison of the two approaches. Using several real-world data sets, we evaluate the performance of the basic models and of several new extensions towards realistic modeling. Furthermore, new insights on solving bicriteria optimization problems in both models are presented. The time-expanded approach turns out to be more robust for modeling more complex scenarios, whereas the time-dependent approach shows a clearly better performance.},

	abstract = {We study a multimodal journey planning scenario consisting of a public transit network and a transfer graph that represents a secondary transportation mode (e.g., walking, cycling, e-scooter). The objective is to compute Pareto-optimal journeys with respect to arrival time and the number of used public transit trips. Whereas various existing algorithms can efficiently compute optimal journeys in either a pure public transit network or a pure transfer graph, combining the two increases running times significantly. Existing approaches, therefore, typically only support limited walking between stops by either imposing a maximum transfer distance or requiring the transfer graph to be transitively closed. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel preprocessing technique called unlimited transfers (ULTRA): given an unlimited transfer graph, which may represent any non–schedule based transportation mode, ULTRA computes a small number of transfer shortcuts that are provably sufficient for computing a Pareto set of optimal journeys. These transfer shortcuts can be integrated into a variety of state-of-the-art public transit algorithms, establishing the ULTRA-query algorithm family. Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that ULTRA improves these algorithms from limited to unlimited transfers without sacrificing query speed. This is true not just for walking, but also for faster transfer modes, such as bicycle or car. Compared with the state of the art for multimodal journey planning, the fastest ULTRA-based algorithm achieves a speedup of an order of magnitude.

	abstract = {We consider the application of route planning in large public-transportation networks (buses, trains, subways, etc). Many connections in such networks are operated at periodic time intervals. When a set of connections has sufficient periodicity, it becomes more efficient to store the time range and frequency (e.g., every 15 minutes from 8:00am-6:00pm) instead of storing each of the time events separately. Identifying an optimal frequency-compression is NP-hard, so we present a time- and space-efficient heuristic. We show how we can use this compression to not only save space but also query time. We particularly consider profile queries, which ask for all optimal routes with departure times in a given interval (e.g., a whole day). In particular, we design a new version of Dijkstra's algorithm that works with frequency-based labels and is suitable for profile queries. We evaluate the savings of our approach on two metropolitan and three country-wide public-transportation networks. On our largest network, we simultaneously achieve a better space consumption than all previous methods as well as profile query times that are about 5 times faster than the best previous method. We also improve Transfer Patterns, a state-of-the-art technique for fully realistic route planning in large public-transportation networks. In particular, we accelerate the expensive preprocessing by a factor of 60 compared to the original publication.},

On such large networks, existing approaches suffer from either a very large space consumption, a very long preprocessing time or slow query processing. Transfer Patterns, a state-of-the-art technique for route planning in transit networks, achieves excellent query times, but the space consumption is large and the preprocessing time is huge. In this paper, we introduce a new scheme for the Transfer Pattern precomputation and query graph construction that reduces both the necessary preprocessing time and space consumption by an order of magnitude and more. Average query times are below 1 ms for local queries, independent of the size of the network, around 30 ms for non-local queries on the complete transit network of Germany, and an estimated 200 ms for a fictitious transit network covering the currently available data of the whole world.},

	abstract = {We study the problem of computing all Pareto-optimal journeys in a dynamic public transit network for multiple criteria, such as arrival time and number of transfers. Existing algorithms consider this as a graph problem and solve it using various graph search algorithms. Unfortunately, this leads to either high query times or suboptimal solutions. We take a different approach. We introduce RAPTOR, our novel round-based public transit router. Unlike previous algorithms, it is not Dijkstra-based, looks at each route (such as a bus line) in the network at most once per round, and can be made even faster with simple pruning rules and parallelization using multiple cores. Because it does not rely on preprocessing, RAPTOR works in fully dynamic scenarios. Starting from arrival time and number of transfers as criteria, it can be easily extended to handle flexible departure times or arbitrary additional criteria. As practical examples we consider fare zones and reliability of transfers. When run on complex public transportation networks (such as London), RAPTOR computes all Pareto-optimal journeys between two random locations an order of magnitude faster than previous approaches, which easily enables interactive applications.},

We introduce a novel algorithmic framework, called Connection Scan Algorithm (CSA), to compute journeys. It organizes data as a single array of connections, which it scans once per query. Despite its simplicity, our algorithm is very versatile. We use it to solve earliest arrival and multi-criteria profile queries. Moreover, we extend it to handle the minimum expected arrival time (MEAT) problem, which incorporates stochastic delays on the vehicles and asks for a set of (alternative) journeys that in its entirety minimizes the user’s expected arrival time at the destination. Our experiments on the dense metropolitan network of London show that CSA computes MEAT queries, our most complex scenario, in 272 ms on average.},

We take into account many realistic features like: traffic days, walking between stations, queries between geographic locations instead of a source and a target station, and multi-criteria cost functions. Our algorithm is based on two key observations: (1) many shortest paths share the same transfer pattern, i.e., the sequence of stations where a change of vehicle occurs; (2) direct connections without change of vehicle can be looked up quickly. We precompute the respective data; in practice, this can be done in time linear in the network size, at the expense of a small fraction of non-optimal results. We have accelerated public transportation routing on Google Maps with a system based on our ideas. We report experimental results for three data sets of various kinds and sizes.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel information retrieval approach for personalized itinerary search in urban freight transport systems. The proposed approach is based on the integration of three techniques: Case Base Reasoning, Choquet integral and ontology. It has the following advanced features: (1) user-oriented ontology is used as source of knowledge to extract pertinent information about stakeholder’s preferences and needs; (2) semantic web rule language is considered to provide the system with enhanced semantic capabilities and support personalized case representation; (3) a CBR-personalized retrieval mechanism is designed to provide a user with an optimum itinerary that meets his personal needs and preferences. The above features lead to a personalized and optimum itinerary search that meets the user’s needs as specified in their queries such as fuel consumption, environmental impact, optimum route, time management etc. This has the potential to effectively manage fright movement according to stakeholder’s needs and alleviate congestion problems in urban areas. The proposed intelligent decision support system (Onto-CBR) is implemented to an itinerary search problem for freight transportation users in urban areas. Its performance is further compared to an itineraries search system that was proposed by the authors in an earlier publication. Both approaches are compared in terms of their ability to meet user’s personal preferences and achieve accuracy in case retrieval. The experimental results showed the ability of the proposed system to improve the accuracy of case retrieval and reduce retrieval time prominently. The ability of the proposed system tailor the search to stakeholders needs, improve the accuracy of case retrieval and facilitate the search process are among the main positive features of the proposed intelligent decision support system.},

	abstract = {To support the sharing and reuse of formally represented knowledge among AI systems, it is useful to define the common vocabulary in which shared knowledge is represented. A specification of a representational vocabulary for a shared domain of discourse—definitions of classes, relations, functions, and other objects—is called an ontology. This paper describes a mechanism for defining ontologies that are portable over representation systems. Definitions written in a standard format for predicate calculus are translated by a system called Ontolingua into specialized representations, including frame-based systems as well as relational languages. This allows researchers to share and reuse ontologies, while retaining the computational benefits of specialized implementations. We discuss how the translation approach to portability addresses several technical problems. One problem is how to accommodate the stylistic and organizational differences among representations while preserving declarative content. Another is how to translate from a very expressive language into restricted languages, remaining system-independent while preserving the computational efficiency of implemented systems. We describe how these problems are addressed by basing Ontolingua itself on an ontology of domain-independent, representational idioms.},

	abstract = {Wheelchair users looking for accessible public transport routes, tourists discovering attractive routes to go around a new city, or bicycle users trying to avoid highly polluted routes are some examples where highly individualized route planning is needed. Current route planning applications lack query flexibility. The types of queries supported by a route planner are only determined at design time and heavily depend on centralized pre-selected data sources. Integrating a new data source such as another transport mode, a different road network or wheelchair accessibility is not straightforward as it generally requires human intervention to extend the subjacent data model and route planning algorithm implementation. I investigate how relevant data sources available on the Web can be dynamically reused for answering custom queries, and thus allow creating more flexible and personalized route planning applications. Semantic Web and Linked Data technologies provide a common framework for data integration. Yet it is still unclear how relevant data can be automatically reused while remaining independent from specific route planning algorithm implementations. Preliminary work (i) tests the feasibility of solving route planning queries over live and static public transport data sources on the Web, (ii) explores the trade-offs of different Web APIs for publishing and consuming live data streams on the Web and (iii) introduces a Linked Data based approach for publishing road networks data.},
