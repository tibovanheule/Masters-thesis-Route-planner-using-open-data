First and foremost, I would like to thank my thesis promotors, Ruben Verborgh and Pieter Colpaert, for their invaluable support and feedback. Also, I would like to thank Julian Andres Rojas Melendez for his guidance throughout my Semantic Web and Transit planning research.

I am also grateful to my parents, sisters and girlfriend, Shassmita, for their unwavering support and encouragement throughout my academic journey. Your love, patience, and understanding have been the cornerstone of my success.

Next, I want to thank my friends Jan-Pieter Baert, Gertjan De Smet, and Steven Huysentruyt for proofreading, helping me solve problems, working out algorithms, acting as my rubber duck when debugging and listening to my ideas.
